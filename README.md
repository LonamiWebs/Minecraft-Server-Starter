# Minecraft-Server-Starter
A cool, simple and efficent Minecraft Server Starter for Windows

## Features
Add multiple servers, manage them, edit their server.properties files, backup them, op people and ban ~~suckas~~ annoying people, delete servers, add a pretty server-icon.png... And much, much more.

## Screen captures
![Main window capture][cwmain]
![Settings window capture][cwsettings]

## Pending tasks
- The program should be localised to more languages
- The code should be more clean and organised
- Drag and drop function isn't fully working
- Find a correct bold factor for `MOTDTextBox.xaml.cs`

## How to collaborate
I would really be pleased to see your help, just grab this repository, add your own language or clean the code a bit. Surprise me with a new feature? And I'll merge it to the original branch (if I even know how!)!
